This Python code uses the Kivy framework to create a Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) game with a simple GUI. The game consists of a 3x3 grid layout with buttons representing the board cells. Players take turns placing "X" and "O" on the board, with basic AI logic for the computer to play "O". The game includes a Retry button to reset the board and a Result button to determine the winner. The code also integrates sound effects using winsound.Beep() when a move is made. However, the logic for checking the winner (result() function) and some AI decision-making may need improvement for full functionality.
